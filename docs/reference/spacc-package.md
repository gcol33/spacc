# spacc: Fast Spatial Species Accumulation Curves

High-performance spatial species accumulation curves using
nearest-neighbor algorithms. Implements kNN and kNCN sampling methods
with a C++ backend for speed. Supports Hill numbers (q=0,1,2), beta
diversity partitioning (turnover/nestedness), coverage-based
rarefaction, and phylogenetic/functional diversity accumulation.
Multiple starting points (seeds) provide uncertainty quantification.
