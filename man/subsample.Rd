\usage{
subsample(
  coords,
  n = NULL,
  method = c("grid", "random", "thinning"),
  cell_size = NULL,
  min_dist = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A data.frame with columns \code{x} and \code{y} containing site coordinates.}

\item{n}{Integer. Target number of sites to retain. If \code{NULL}, determined
by \code{cell_size} or \code{min_dist}.}

\item{method}{Character. Subsampling method: \code{"grid"} (default), \code{"random"},
or \code{"thinning"}.}

\item{cell_size}{Numeric. Grid cell size for \code{method = "grid"}. One site
retained per cell.}

\item{min_dist}{Numeric. Minimum distance between retained sites for
\code{method = "thinning"}.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of row indices to retain.
}
\description{
Reduce spatial autocorrelation by subsampling sites using various methods.
}
\details{
\strong{Methods:}
\itemize{
\item \code{"grid"}: Overlay a grid and retain one random site per cell.
\item \code{"random"}: Simple random subsample of n sites.
\item \code{"thinning"}: Iteratively remove sites until minimum distance is achieved.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Grid-based subsampling
keep <- subsample(coords, method = "grid", cell_size = 10)
sac <- spacc(species[keep, ], coords[keep, ])

# Minimum distance thinning
keep <- subsample(coords, method = "thinning", min_dist = 5)
}
