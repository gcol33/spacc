\title{Exact (Mao Tau) Expected Accumulation}
\usage{
mao_tau(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A site-by-species matrix (presence/absence or abundance).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns: sites, expected, sd, lower, upper
}
\description{
Compute the expected species accumulation curve using sample-based
rarefaction (Mao Tau estimator). This is analytically identical to
the expected curve from random permutations.
