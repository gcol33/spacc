\usage{
spaccCoverage(
  x,
  coords,
  n_seeds = 50L,
  method = "knn",
  distance = c("euclidean", "haversine"),
  parallel = TRUE,
  n_cores = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A site-by-species matrix with abundance data.}

\item{coords}{A data.frame with columns \code{x} and \code{y}, or a \code{spacc_dist} object.}

\item{n_seeds}{Integer. Number of random starting points. Default 50.}

\item{method}{Character. Accumulation method. Default \code{"knn"}.}

\item{distance}{Character. Distance method: \code{"euclidean"} or \code{"haversine"}.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Use parallel processing? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores.}

\item{progress}{Logical. Show progress? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{spacc_coverage} containing:
\item{richness}{Matrix of species richness (n_seeds x n_sites)}
\item{individuals}{Matrix of individual counts}
\item{coverage}{Matrix of coverage estimates}
\item{coords, n_seeds, n_sites, method}{Parameters used}
}
\description{
Compute spatial accumulation curves with sample coverage tracking.
Allows standardization by completeness (coverage) rather than sample size,
following Chao & Jost (2012).
}
\details{
Sample coverage (Chao & Jost 2012) estimates the proportion of the total
community abundance represented by observed species. It provides a measure
of sampling completeness that is independent of sample size.

Coverage-based rarefaction allows fair comparison of diversity across
communities with different abundances by standardizing to equal completeness
rather than equal sample size.

\examples{
\dontrun{
coords <- data.frame(x = runif(50), y = runif(50))
species <- matrix(rpois(50 * 30, 2), nrow = 50)

cov <- spaccCoverage(species, coords)
plot(cov)

# Interpolate richness at 90\% and 95\% coverage
interp <- interpolateCoverage(cov, target = c(0.90, 0.95))
}
